## User Experience Examples

### Starting a Square-Powered Business

Goose: Great idea! I'll help you start Brew & Bytes with full Square integration. Let me gather some details:

What type of business entity would you prefer?
- LLC (simpler, good for local businesses)  
- C-Corp (if you plan to expand/franchise)

User: LLC is fine, this will be a local shop in Austin, Texas

Goose: Perfect! I'll need:
- Your full name and address
- Email address
- Will you need both in-store POS and online ordering?

User: Sarah Chen, sarah@brewbytes.com, 1234 S Congress Ave Austin TX. Yes, both in-store and online.
