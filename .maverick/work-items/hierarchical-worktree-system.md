# Hierarchical Git Worktree Management System

## 📋 Overview

Design and implement a hierarchical worktree management system that organizes Git worktrees in a clean `/tmp/repos/{project}/{branch}/` structure with standardized branch naming conventions and automated worktree lifecycle management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current git worktree management creates sibling directories that become difficult to organize and navigate. We need a systematic approach that:
- Creates logical project-based hierarchies
- Enforces consistent, self-describing branch names
- Automates worktree creation, switching, and cleanup
- Integrates seamlessly with our `.maverick/` system

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
/users/tim/dev/square/maverick/tmp/repos/
├── maverick/                      # Project root
│   ├── .git/                      # Git metadata (shared)
│   ├── main/                      # Main branch worktree
│   │   ├── .maverick/             # Main project context
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── feat-vibe-chat-interface/  # Feature worktree
│   │   ├── .maverick/             # Feature-specific context
│   │   └── ...
│   └── fix-claude-streaming/      # Bug fix worktree
├── wine-project/                  # Different project
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── main/
│   └── feat-inventory-system/
└── legal-docs/                    # Non-code project
    ├── .git/
    ├── main/
    └── feat-incorporation-docs/
```

### Branch Naming Strategy
**Standard Prefixes:**
- `main` - Main/production branch
- `feat-{description}` - New features
- `fix-{description}` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor-{description}` - Code refactoring
- `docs-{description}` - Documentation updates
- `test-{description}` - Testing improvements
- `chore-{description}` - Maintenance tasks

**Naming Rules:**
- Kebab-case slugs: `feat-user-authentication`
- Self-describing: `feat-payment-processing` not `feat-payments`
- Scoped when needed: `feat-dashboard-analytics`
- 2-4 words maximum for readability

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Worktree Manager Service
```typescript
class WorktreeManager {
  // Create new worktree with standardized naming
  async createWorktree(project: string, branchType: string, description: string)
  
  // Switch between worktrees
  async switchWorktree(project: string, branch: string)
  
  // List all worktrees for a project
  async listWorktrees(project: string)
  
  // Clean up completed/merged worktrees
  async cleanupWorktree(project: string, branch: string)
  
  // Validate branch naming conventions
  validateBranchName(name: string): boolean
}
```

#### 2. Branch Name Generator
```typescript
class BranchNameGenerator {
  // Generate standardized branch names
  generateFeatureBranch(description: string): string
  generateBugfixBranch(description: string): string
  generateRefactorBranch(description: string): string
  
  // Validate naming conventions
  validateName(branchName: string): ValidationResult
  
  // Suggest improvements for branch names
  suggestImprovements(branchName: string): string[]
}
```

#### 3. UI Integration
- **Worktree Selector**: Dropdown/sidebar for switching between worktrees
- **Branch Creator**: Form with type selection and auto-slug generation
- **Worktree Status**: Visual indicators for each worktree's status
- **Quick Actions**: Create, switch, merge, cleanup buttons

### Git Operations

#### Worktree Creation Process
1. Validate project exists in `/tmp/repos/{project}/`
2. Generate standardized branch name from user input
3. Create new worktree: `git worktree add {project}/{branch-name} origin/main`
4. Initialize `.maverick/` structure in new worktree
5. Set up branch tracking and initial commit

#### Cleanup Process
1. Check if branch is merged to main
2. Remove worktree: `git worktree remove {project}/{branch-name}`
3. Delete remote branch if needed
4. Clean up any temporary files

## 📊 User Experience Flow

### Creating New Feature
1. User clicks "New Feature" in UI
2. Enters feature description: "vibe chat interface"
3. System generates: `feat-vibe-chat-interface`
4. Creates worktree at `tmp/repos/maverick/feat-vibe-chat-interface/`
5. Initializes independent `.maverick/` context
6. User immediately starts working in isolated environment

### Switching Context
1. User selects different worktree from dropdown
2. System updates file explorer to new worktree location
3. AI context switches to worktree-specific `.maverick/`
4. All tools (Claude Code, file operations) work in new context

## 🔍 System Integration Points

### Maverick Platform Integration
- **File Operations**: All read/write operations respect current worktree
- **AI Context**: Each worktree maintains independent AI chat history
- **Work Items**: Feature-specific work items stored per worktree
- **Build System**: Isolated builds per worktree

### Git Workflow Integration
- **Branch Protection**: Enforce naming conventions before creation
- **Merge Strategy**: Automated PR creation when feature complete
- **Conflict Resolution**: Tools for managing merge conflicts
- **History Management**: Clean commit history per feature

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 2: UI Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Add worktree selector to project interface
- [ ] Create branch creation form with validation
- [ ] Implement worktree status indicators
