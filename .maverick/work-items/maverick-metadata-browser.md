# Build Interactive .maverick Metadata Browser with Core Instructions Viewer

## 📋 Description
Create an interactive browser for viewing and managing the .maverick directory structure, core project instructions, and living documentation - abstracting file system complexity into a user-friendly interface that business owners can easily navigate and understand.

## 🎯 Business Value
- **Project DNA Visibility**: Users can see and understand their project's core instructions
- **Living Documentation**: Interactive view of how project principles evolve over time
- **AI Context Control**: Clear interface for managing what AI agents understand about the project
- **Non-Technical Friendly**: File system abstraction makes it accessible to business users

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **File System Abstraction**: Show "Project Principles" instead of ".maverick/docs/core-instructions.md"
- **Interactive Browser**: Navigate project metadata without technical file paths
- **Markdown Renderer**: Beautiful display of .md files with syntax highlighting
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific instructions, principles, or documentation
- **Edit Capabilities**: In-browser editing of core instructions and project metadata

### User Experience
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Distinguish between pinned/permanent vs contextual instructions
- **Change Tracking**: Highlight recently modified instructions and show history
- **Usage Analytics**: Show which instructions are most referenced by AI agents
- **Smart Organization**: Group related documentation and show relationships

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory scanner recursively indexes .maverick structure
- [ ] File system abstraction presents user-friendly categories
- [ ] Markdown renderer with syntax highlighting works
- [ ] Search functionality across all documentation
- [ ] In-browser editing capabilities
- [ ] Visual indicators for file types and importance
- [ ] Change tracking and recent activity display
- [ ] AI agent usage analytics for different instructions

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Markdown rendering library
- File system watching capabilities
- Git integration for version history
- Search indexing system

## 💬 Notes & Updates
This is the "control center" for project intelligence and makes Maverick's AI-native approach transparent to users. Should integrate with the existing work-item system and show relationships between documentation and active development.
