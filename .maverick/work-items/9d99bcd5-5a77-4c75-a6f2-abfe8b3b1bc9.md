# Auto-collapse Canvas Columns & List View Toggle

## 📋 Description
Implement automatic collapsing of complete and deferred columns on the Project Canvas to maximize space for active work items. Add toggle functionality to switch between canvas and list view modes for improved readability and user preference accommodation.

**Original Request:** "On the Project Canvas, we should auto-collapse complete and deferred columns since we won't view them often. this would make more space for the other columns to actually read the titles. we may want to be able to switch to list mode as well"

- **Status:** PENDING

## ✅ AI-Generated Tasks

### 1. Implement column auto-collapse logic
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 1d | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Create functionality to automatically collapse complete and deferred status columns by default, with expand/collapse toggle controls

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete and deferred columns collapsed by default
- Toggle buttons allow manual expand/collapse
- State persists across sessions



### 2. Dynamic column width adjustment
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Implement responsive column sizing that redistributes available space when columns are collapsed/expanded

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Remaining columns expand to fill available space
- Smooth transitions between states
- Maintains minimum readable width

**Dependencies:** task-1

### 3. List view mode implementation
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Duration:** 2d | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Create alternative list view that displays work items in a compact table format with sortable columns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Table view with sortable columns
- Shows all relevant work item data
- Maintains filtering capabilities



### 4. View toggle component
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Build UI component that allows users to switch between canvas and list view modes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Toggle button in header/toolbar
- Preserves current filters and selections
- Smooth transition between views

**Dependencies:** task-3

### 5. User preference persistence
**Priority:** LOW | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Store user's preferred view mode and column collapse states in local storage or user settings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Remembers view preference across sessions
- Remembers column collapse states
- Graceful fallback for new users

**Dependencies:** task-1, task-4


## 🚀 Identified Opportunities

### Advanced filtering in list view
**Type:** FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT | **Impact:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Timeline:** Following sprint

Add enhanced filtering and search capabilities specifically for list view mode

**Potential Value:** Improved work item discovery and management

### Customizable column display
**Type:** FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT | **Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Timeline:** Next quarter

Allow users to choose which columns are visible and their order in both views

**Potential Value:** Personalized workflow optimization


## ⚠️ Potential Risks

### Performance impact with large datasets
**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** MEDIUM

Dynamic column resizing and view switching could cause performance issues with many work items

**Impact Areas:** User Experience, Performance

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement virtualization for large lists and optimize re-rendering

### User workflow disruption
**Severity:** LOW | **Probability:** HIGH

Auto-collapsing columns might confuse users who frequently access complete/deferred items

**Impact Areas:** User Adoption, Workflow

**Mitigation Strategy:** Provide clear visual indicators and user education, make behavior configurable


## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete and deferred columns are collapsed by default on canvas view
- [ ] Remaining columns utilize the additional space effectively
- [ ] Users can toggle between canvas and list view modes
- [ ] All work item data remains accessible in both views
- [ ] User preferences persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with existing work item volumes

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

- Ensure responsive design works across different screen sizes
- Maintain existing drag-and-drop functionality in canvas view
- Consider accessibility requirements for both view modes
- Plan for potential integration with existing filtering system
- Design for extensibility to support future column types

## 📚 Resources & References
- [ ] Add relevant documentation links
- [ ] Include design mockups or wireframes  
- [ ] List external dependencies
- [ ] Note any architectural decisions
