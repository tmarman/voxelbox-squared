# Project Canvas & Work Item Management

## 📋 Description
The SimpleWorkItemCanvas is an AI-powered project management interface that automatically organizes work items across four lifecycle stages (Plan, Execute, Review, Complete) using intelligent text processing. Users can create tasks by simply describing what they want to accomplish in natural language, and the system uses AI to structure and categorize the work appropriately. The component provides a kanban-style board view with detailed work item management through an integrated sidebar interface.

**Key capabilities for organizing tasks across stages:**

• **Smart work item creation** - Natural language input automatically categorized by AI into appropriate work item types (features, bugs, epics) with proper status assignments

• **Stage-based workflow organization** - Four-column kanban board that groups tasks by lifecycle stage (Plan, Execute, Review, Complete) with automatic status-based filtering  

• **Integrated GitHub worktree management** - Each work item can be linked to dedicated Git branches with worktree status tracking and branch management capabilities

**Original Feature Category:** Project Management
**Components:** SimpleWorkItemCanvas, WorkItemDetailSidebar, WorkItemManager
**Key Files:** src/components/SimpleWorkItemCanvas.tsx, src/components/WorkItemDetailSidebar.tsx, src/app/api/projects/[name]/work-items/
