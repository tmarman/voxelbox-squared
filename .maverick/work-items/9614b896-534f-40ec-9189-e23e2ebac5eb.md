# AI-Powered Work Item Analysis

## 📋 Description
Structured AI integration that leverages Claude and Gemini APIs to intelligently analyze user input and automatically generate comprehensive work items containing detailed tasks, business opportunities, and risk assessments. The system provides consistent, actionable project breakdowns by transforming natural language requirements into structured development workflows.

• **Standardized JSON responses** - Returns consistent structured data with predefined schemas for tasks, opportunities, and risks across all AI providers
• **Multi-provider fallback system** - Automatically switches between Claude and Gemini APIs to ensure reliability and optimize response quality based on request type
• **Intelligent prompt engineering** - Uses specialized prompts for different analysis types (technical tasks, business opportunities, risk assessment) to maximize AI output quality

**Original Feature Category:** AI & Automation
**Components:** StructuredAIProvider
**Key Files:** src/lib/structured-ai-provider.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/app/api/projects/[name]/work-items/smart-create/
