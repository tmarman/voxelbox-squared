# Executive-Level Project Overview Dashboard

## 📋 Vision Statement

Transform the project details page into an executive-level dashboard that provides the kind of high-level insights a sponsor, executive, or investor needs. Think board meeting updates, VC investment reviews, or quarterly business reviews - clear, concise, actionable intelligence.

## 🎯 Executive Requirements

### The "Board Update" Perspective
Users described this as: "I'm thinking of this like I'm the sponsor of a number of different tentpoles/projects, and they're each coming and giving me updates. Or like I'm a VC, these are my investments and I get my monthly or quarterly board updates."

### Key Information Hierarchy
1. **Project Health Summary** - Red/Yellow/Green status at a glance
2. **Active Work Streams** - What's currently in progress
3. **Key Metrics** - Progress indicators and trend data
4. **Risk Assessment** - What needs attention
5. **Resource Utilization** - Team allocation and capacity
6. **Financial Overview** - Budget status and burn rate (future)

## 🏗️ Dashboard Components

### 1. Executive Summary Card
```typescript
interface ExecutiveSummary {
  projectName: string
  healthStatus: 'healthy' | 'at-risk' | 'critical' | 'on-track'
  overallProgress: number // 0-100%
  lastUpdated: Date
  nextMilestone: {
    name: string
    dueDate: Date
    progress: number
  }
  keyMetrics: {
    featuresDelivered: number
    featuresInProgress: number
    featuresPlanned: number
    teamVelocity: number
  }
}
```

### 2. Active Work Streams
```typescript
interface WorkStream {
  id: string
  title: string
  type: 'feature' | 'epic' | 'initiative'
  status: 'in-progress' | 'blocked' | 'review' | 'testing'
  progress: number
  owner: string
  estimatedCompletion: Date
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  lastActivity: Date
}
```

### 3. Health Indicators
- **Velocity Trends**: Sprint-over-sprint completion rates
- **Quality Metrics**: Bug rates, test coverage, performance
- **Team Health**: Capacity utilization, blockers, dependencies
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback scores, review completion

### 4. Risk Dashboard
- **Blocked Items**: Count and duration of blocked work
- **Overdue Tasks**: Items past their target dates
- **Resource Constraints**: Team capacity issues
- **Dependency Risks**: External dependencies and their status

```typescript
interface ProjectHealth {
  calculateOverallHealth(workItems: WorkItem[]): HealthStatus
  generateVelocityTrends(completionHistory: CompletionEvent[]): TrendData
  identifyRisks(workItems: WorkItem[], timeline: Timeline): Risk[]
  calculateResourceUtilization(team: TeamMember[], workload: Workload): UtilizationMetrics
}

interface ExecutiveDashboardService {
