# Project Overview Dashboard on Projects List Page

## 📋 Description
Integrate an "At a Glance" overview dashboard into the projects list page. When a user selects a project, this view will display key metrics such as active work trees, the last updated timestamp, and other relevant data from the main project overview, providing a quick summary without navigating away.

**Original Request:** "let's bring an overview-style dashboard within the project to the projects list page. When you select a project, you should see an "At a Glance" view, including active work trees, last updated, and some of the other relevant metrics on the inner project overview"

## 🏷️ Classification
- **Type:** FEATURE
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Functional Area:** SOFTWARE
- **Estimated Effort:** 3d
- **Business Impact:** Improves user productivity by providing quick project insights on the main list page, reducing the need for deep navigation and enhancing overall situational awareness for active projects.

## 🌿 Development Branch
- **Branch:** `feature/project-overview-dashboard-on-projects-list-page`
- **Status:** Ready for creation

## ✅ AI-Generated Tasks

### 1. Design "At a Glance" Dashboard UI/UX
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** DESIGN

Create wireframes or mockups for the project overview dashboard. Define the layout, component structure, and data presentation for key metrics like active work trees, last updated, and project status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Design is approved by the product team
- Mockup includes all required metrics
- Component layout is defined



### 2. Develop API Endpoint for Project Dashboard Data
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 1d | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Create a new API endpoint to aggregate and serve the data required for the "At a Glance" view. This includes project metadata, last update timestamp, and a list of active work trees from the version control integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Endpoint returns all necessary data in a single call
- Endpoint is performant and optimized for quick loading
- Data for active work trees is correctly retrieved



### 3. Build ProjectDashboard React Component
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 1d | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Develop the frontend component for the "At a Glance" dashboard using React. Implement the UI based on the approved design and connect it to the new API endpoint for data fetching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Component renders correctly with fetched data
- Component matches the UI/UX design
- Loading and error states are handled gracefully

**Dependencies:** task-1, task-2

### 4. Integrate Dashboard into Projects List Page
**Priority:** HIGH | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** DEVELOPMENT

Modify the existing projects list page to display the new "At a Glance" dashboard when a project is selected. Ensure proper state management, routing, and that the dashboard appears smoothly without a full page reload.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard is displayed upon project selection
- Dashboard is hidden when no project is selected
- Integration does not negatively impact the performance of the projects list

**Dependencies:** task-3

### 5. Add Tests for Project Dashboard
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Duration:** 4h | **Category:** TESTING

Write unit and integration tests for the new ProjectDashboard component and its API integration to ensure functionality, cover different states (loading, error, success), and prevent regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests achieve >80% coverage for the new component
- Integration tests verify the end-to-end flow from selection to display

**Dependencies:** task-4


## 🚀 Identified Opportunities

### Enable Real-Time Dashboard Updates
**Type:** FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT | **Impact:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Timeline:** Next sprint

Enhance the dashboard to update key metrics in real-time using WebSockets or server-sent events. This would provide immediate feedback on changes to work tree status or project updates.

**Potential Value:** Provides a more dynamic and responsive user experience, improving situational awareness.

### Customizable Dashboard Metrics
**Type:** FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT | **Impact:** LOW | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Timeline:** Next quarter

Allow users to configure which metrics are displayed on their "At a Glance" dashboard, tailoring the view to their specific needs or role (e.g., a manager might want to see different stats than a developer).

**Potential Value:** Increases personalization and the utility of the dashboard for different user profiles.


## ⚠️ Potential Risks

### Performance Degradation on Projects Page
**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** MEDIUM

Fetching and displaying summary data for a selected project could slow down the interaction on the projects list page, especially if the data aggregation is slow or the list contains many projects.

**Impact Areas:** Performance, User Experience

**Mitigation Strategy:** Lazy-load the dashboard data only after a user selects a project. Ensure backend queries are highly optimized and cache the dashboard data for a short period.

### Data Aggregation Complexity
**Severity:** LOW | **Probability:** MEDIUM

The required metrics (e.g., active work trees, last updated) might be stored across different services or data models, making efficient, real-time aggregation for the API challenging.

**Impact Areas:** Development, Timeline

**Mitigation Strategy:** Perform a data source audit before development. If necessary, create a separate, optimized aggregation service or use materialized views to pre-calculate the data.


## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The 'At a Glance' dashboard is displayed on the projects list page when a project is selected
- [ ] The dashboard correctly shows active work trees, the project's last updated time, and at least two other key project metrics
- [ ] The UI is responsive, performs well, and does not degrade the experience of the main projects list
- [ ] The feature is covered by automated tests

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

- Leverage existing React components, styling, and state management patterns
- Create a new, efficient API endpoint for aggregated project data to minimize client-side load
- Ensure the new component integrates cleanly with the existing project navigation and routing structure found in 'src/app/cockpit/projects/[name]/'

## 📚 Resources & References
