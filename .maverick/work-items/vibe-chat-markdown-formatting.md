# Enhanced Vibe Chat Context Display with Markdown Formatting

## Description

Implemented proper markdown rendering for task context display in the Vibe Chat interface. When users select different tasks to provide context for their AI conversations, the task descriptions now render with full markdown formatting instead of plain text.

## Problem Statement

Users reported that when task context was displayed in the Vibe Chat interface, markdown formatting was not being applied. Task descriptions containing **bold text**, *italics*, `code blocks`, lists, and other markdown elements were showing as raw markup instead of formatted content.

## Solution Implemented

### Technical Implementation

1. **Added React Markdown Dependencies**
   - Imported `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` plugins
   - Location: `src/components/VibeChat.tsx:26-27`

2. **Enhanced Context Display Component**
   - Replaced plain text display with ReactMarkdown component
   - Added custom component styling for prose rendering
   - Location: `src/components/VibeChat.tsx:468-483`

3. **Custom Styling Components**
   ```jsx
   components={{
     p: ({ children }) => <p className="mb-1 last:mb-0">{children}</p>,
     ul: ({ children }) => <ul className="list-disc ml-4 mb-1">{children}</ul>,
     ol: ({ children }) => <ol className="list-decimal ml-4 mb-1">{children}</ol>,
     li: ({ children }) => <li className="mb-0.5">{children}</li>,
     strong: ({ children }) => <strong className="font-semibold">{children}</strong>,
     em: ({ children }) => <em className="italic">{children}</em>,
     code: ({ children }) => <code className="bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded text-xs">{children}</code>
   }}
   ```

4. **Improved Layout Design**
   - Enhanced context container with better visual hierarchy
   - Added border and improved spacing
   - Maximum height with scroll for long descriptions

## User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Clarity**: Task descriptions now display with proper formatting
- **Better Readability**: Lists, emphasis, and code blocks are properly styled
- **Consistent Design**: Matches the rest of the application's markdown rendering
- **Compact Display**: Scrollable container prevents context from overwhelming the chat

## Testing Performed

- Verified markdown rendering with various task descriptions
- Tested bold, italic, lists, and code formatting
- Confirmed responsive design on different screen sizes
- Validated that context selection and clearing still work correctly

## Files Modified

- `src/components/VibeChat.tsx` - Added markdown rendering support

## Business Value

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience when working with task context in AI conversations. Users can now easily read and understand formatted task descriptions, making the AI chat more effective for project planning and development discussions.

## Technical Debt Considerations

- Dependencies on `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` are already in package.json
- No additional technical debt introduced
- Follows existing patterns used elsewhere in the application

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Potential to expand markdown support to chat messages themselves
- Could add markdown preview for task editing interfaces
