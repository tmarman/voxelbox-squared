# Automatic Feature Extraction & Analysis System

## 📋 Vision Statement

Transform repository import into an intelligent feature discovery process where EVERY major category, component, and capability is automatically identified, cataloged, and enhanced with AI-powered improvement suggestions. This system creates a comprehensive map of existing functionality while providing actionable recommendations for evolution and enhancement.

## 🎯 Core Concept

When a repository is imported or created, Maverick should:

1. **Analyze & Extract**: Scan the entire codebase to identify all features, components, APIs, and capabilities
2. **Categorize & Structure**: Organize findings into logical feature groups and functional areas
3. **Document Current State**: Create detailed work items describing what exists today
4. **Generate Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for improvements, enhancements, and new capabilities
5. **Store in Workspace**: All analysis stored as markdown files in the `.maverick` workspace structure

## 🔍 Feature Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis
- **File Structure Scanning**: Map directory structure and identify architectural patterns
- **Component Identification**: Detect React components, API routes, database models, utilities
- **Dependency Analysis**: Catalog external libraries, frameworks, and integrations
- **Configuration Discovery**: Find build configs, environment variables, deployment settings
- **Test Coverage Mapping**: Identify existing tests and coverage gaps

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction
- **UI Components**: Extract all user-facing components with their props and functionality
- **API Endpoints**: Catalog all routes, methods, parameters, and responses
- **Business Logic**: Identify core business rules, validations, and workflows
- **Data Models**: Map database schemas, relationships, and data flows
- **Integration Points**: Document external service connections and webhooks

### Phase 3: Intelligent Categorization
- **Functional Areas**: Group features by business domain (auth, payments, analytics, etc.)
- **Technical Categories**: Organize by technical function (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
- **User Journey Mapping**: Connect features to user workflows and experiences
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate feature importance and usage patterns
- **Complexity Analysis**: Assess technical complexity and maintenance requirements

### Phase 4: Enhancement Suggestions
- **Performance Opportunities**: Identify optimization possibilities
- **Security Improvements**: Suggest security enhancements and best practices
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Recommend UX/UI improvements
- **Feature Extensions**: Propose logical next steps and enhancements
- **Technical Debt**: Highlight areas needing refactoring or modernization

### 2025-08-03 08:10:00 - Major Architecture Feedback: AI-First Approach
- **Feedback**: "I think for these kinds of things, especially the scanning stuff, we should rely on our AI integrations (i.e., Claude) to do this. It's really about orchestration, instruction and context (the last of which we'll give with the file based solution)."
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Complete architecture pivot needed
- **Action**: Refactor from complex parsing to AI orchestration approach
- **Why Critical**: Simpler, more powerful, leverages AI capabilities instead of reinventing analysis

### 2025-08-03 08:11:00 - Integration Feedback: MCP Server for Tool Integration
