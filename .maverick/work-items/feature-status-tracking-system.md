# Feature Status Tracking and Branch-Based Development Workflow

## Description

Implement comprehensive feature status tracking that follows features through their entire lifecycle - from initial planning to production deployment. This system will use git branches as the foundation for feature isolation and provide clear visibility into where each feature stands in the development pipeline.

## Problem Statement

Currently, we track work items and todos, but we don't have clear visibility into:
- **Feature Readiness**: Is this feature ready for testing? Staging? Production?
- **Deployment Status**: Where is this feature currently deployed?
- **Branch Management**: Features developed on main branch without proper isolation
- **Testing Coordination**: No clear handoff between development and testing phases
- **Release Planning**: Difficult to bundle features for coordinated releases

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Git-Based Feature Workflow

```
main
├── feature/team-management-overhaul (ready for testing)
├── feature/vibe-chat-enhancements (in development)
├── feature/azure-deployment (merged, deployed to staging)
└── feature/mcp-server-integration (planned)
```

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/feature-name` - Individual feature development
- `feature/feature-name/subfeature` - Complex features with sub-components
- `staging` - Integration testing environment
- `hotfix/issue-name` - Critical production fixes

### 2. Feature Status Lifecycle

```
PLANNED → IN_DEVELOPMENT → READY_FOR_TESTING → IN_TESTING → 
READY_FOR_STAGING → IN_STAGING → READY_FOR_PRODUCTION → DEPLOYED
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **PLANNED**: Work item created, requirements defined
- **IN_DEVELOPMENT**: Active development on feature branch
- **READY_FOR_TESTING**: Development complete, ready for QA
- **IN_TESTING**: Feature being tested (could be dev, staging, or dedicated test env)
- **READY_FOR_STAGING**: Testing passed, ready for integration testing
- **IN_STAGING**: Deployed to staging environment for final validation
- **READY_FOR_PRODUCTION**: All approvals complete, ready for release
- **DEPLOYED**: Live in production environment

### 3. Feature Tracking Data Structure

```yaml
feature_status:
  id: "team-management-overhaul"
  title: "Workspace Team Management System Overhaul"
  branch: "feature/team-management-overhaul"
  status: "READY_FOR_TESTING"
  environments:
    development: 
      deployed: true
      commit: "81afc61"
      deployed_at: "2025-08-03T22:10:00Z"
    staging:
      deployed: false
      target_date: "2025-08-04T10:00:00Z"
    production:
      deployed: false
      target_date: "2025-08-05T15:00:00Z"
  testing:
    manual_testing: "pending"
    automated_tests: "passed"
    user_acceptance: "not_started"
  dependencies:
    - "vibe-chat-markdown-formatting"
  blocked_by: []
  pull_request: "https://github.com/tmarman/maverick/pull/123"

  approvals_received: 0
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Branch Creation Automation**
   - CLI command: `maverick feature create team-management-overhaul`
   - Auto-creates feature branch from main
   - Initializes feature tracking metadata

2. **Status Tracking Integration**
   - Add `feature_status` field to work item frontmatter
   - Create status update commands
   - Visual indicators in project dashboard

3. **Environment Tracking**
   - Track which environments have which features
   - Deployment status per environment
   - Commit SHA tracking per deployment

### Phase 2: Automation (Week 2)
1. **GitHub Integration**
   - Auto-create pull requests when feature marked "READY_FOR_TESTING"
   - Status updates based on PR events
   - Branch protection rules for feature workflow

2. **Deployment Pipeline Integration**
   - Auto-deploy to staging when PR approved
   - Environment-specific feature flags
   - Rollback capabilities

3. **Testing Coordination**
   - Test result integration
   - Manual testing checklists
   - User acceptance tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
1. **Feature Dependencies**
   - Dependency graph visualization
   - Blocking relationship management
   - Release planning based on dependencies

2. **Release Management**
   - Bundle features into releases
   - Coordinated deployment strategies
   - Feature flag management

## User Stories

### For Developers
- **As a developer**, I can create a feature branch with `maverick feature create` and have tracking set up automatically
- **As a developer**, I can see the deployment status of my feature across all environments
- **As a developer**, I can mark my feature as "ready for testing" and have it automatically create a PR

### For Project Managers
- **As a PM**, I can see all features and their current status in a dashboard view
- **As a PM**, I can track which features are blocked and what they're waiting on
- **As a PM**, I can plan releases by bundling features that are ready for production

### For QA/Testing
- **As a tester**, I can see which features are ready for testing and where to test them
- **As a tester**, I can update test status and have it reflected in the feature tracking
- **As a tester**, I can see feature dependencies to plan integration testing

### For DevOps
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I can see which features need deployment to which environments
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I can track deployment history and rollback if needed
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I can coordinate releases across multiple features

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Work Item Schema Enhancement
```yaml
---
id: feature-id
title: Feature Title
type: FEATURE
status: IN_DEVELOPMENT
feature_status: READY_FOR_TESTING  # New field
branch: feature/feature-name       # New field
environments:                      # New section
  development:
    deployed: true
    commit: "abc123"
    url: "https://dev.maverick.com"
  staging:
    deployed: false
  production:
    deployed: false
---
```

### 2. CLI Commands
```bash
# Feature lifecycle management
maverick feature create feature-name
maverick feature status feature-name
maverick feature deploy staging feature-name
maverick feature test-ready feature-name
maverick feature production-ready feature-name

# Status queries
maverick status --environment=staging
maverick status --feature=team-management
maverick status --ready-for-testing
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- **Feature Status Board**: Kanban-style view of features by status
- **Environment Dashboard**: What's deployed where
- **Release Planning**: Bundle features for coordinated releases
- **Dependency Visualization**: Feature dependency graph

## Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- **Feature Cycle Time**: Time from planned to deployed
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often features reach production
- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage of features that need rollbacks
- **Testing Coverage**: Percentage of features with comprehensive testing

### Process Quality
- **Branch Hygiene**: Percentage of features using proper branch workflow
- **Documentation Completeness**: Features with complete status tracking
- **Dependency Management**: Features blocked by missing dependencies
- **Release Coordination**: Successful multi-feature releases

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Branch Proliferation**: Too many feature branches become unwieldy
  - *Mitigation*: Automated cleanup of merged branches
- **Merge Conflicts**: Features developed in isolation cause conflicts
  - *Mitigation*: Regular main branch integration, dependency tracking

### Process Risks
- **Status Update Overhead**: Developers don't maintain status
  - *Mitigation*: Automated status detection, easy update commands
- **Environment Drift**: Staging doesn't match production
  - *Mitigation*: Infrastructure as code, environment validation
