# Build Intelligent Task Organization System for Smart Create

## 📋 Description
Build an AI-powered system that automatically organizes and groups related tasks during smart create, optimizing worktree usage and preventing duplicate work through intelligent task relationship detection with user-controlled undo capabilities.

## 🎯 Business Value
- **Efficient Development**: Group related work to minimize context switching
- **Worktree Optimization**: Avoid creating separate worktrees for every small task
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Detect and prevent duplicate or overlapping work
- **Smart Organization**: AI understands task relationships and suggests logical groupings

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **Semantic Task Analysis**: AI analyzes task descriptions to identify relationships
- **Automatic Grouping**: Suggest grouping overlapping tasks into single worktrees
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify tasks that are duplicates of existing work
- **Subtask Recognition**: Detect when new tasks are actually subtasks of existing features
- **User Control**: Easy undo/reorganize with user override capabilities

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Semantic Similarity**: Compare task descriptions using embeddings
- **Code Impact Analysis**: Predict which files/components will be affected
- **Dependency Detection**: Identify tasks that depend on each other
- **Context Understanding**: Consider project history and existing task patterns

### Worktree Management
- **Smart Grouping**: "Authentication System" worktree for login, OAuth, password reset
- **Logical Boundaries**: Group by feature area, not arbitrary task creation order
- **Conflict Prevention**: Avoid grouping tasks that would cause merge conflicts
- **Branch Naming**: Generate meaningful branch names for grouped work

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task similarity analysis using embeddings works
- [ ] Task grouping suggestions interface built
- [ ] Basic duplicate detection implemented
- [ ] User controls for accepting/rejecting suggestions
- [ ] Code impact prediction for better grouping decisions
- [ ] Subtask detection and hierarchy suggestions
- [ ] Learning system that improves based on user feedback
- [ ] Integration with worktree creation workflow

## 🔗 Dependencies
- OpenRouter AI integration (✅ completed)
- Task embedding generation system
- Worktree management system (existing)
- User interface for task management (existing)

## 💬 Notes & Updates
This system is core to the intelligent project management experience and directly improves development workflow efficiency. Should work seamlessly with the existing hierarchical work-item system.
