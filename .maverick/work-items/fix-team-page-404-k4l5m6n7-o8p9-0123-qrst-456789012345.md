# Fix Team Page 404 Error

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement

The team page at `http://localhost:5001/app/projects/Maverick/team` is failing with a 404 error. This prevents users from accessing team management functionality for projects.

**User Report**: "http://localhost:5001/app/projects/Maverick/team is failing, we need to fix this page"

## ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely that the team page route doesn't exist in the Next.js app router structure. Based on the URL pattern, we need to create:
- `/src/app/app/projects/[name]/team/page.tsx`

## ðŸ”§ Solution Implementation

### 1. Create Team Page Route
- Create the missing route file at `/src/app/app/projects/[name]/team/page.tsx`
- Implement team management interface
- Integrate with existing project sidebar navigation

### 2. Team Management Features
- Display project team members
- Show roles and permissions
- Add/remove team members functionality
- Team activity and collaboration metrics

### 3. Integration Points
- Connect to user management system
- Integrate with project context
- Update ProjectSidebar to highlight active team page

## ðŸ“Š Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Team page loads without 404 error
- [ ] Page displays current team members
- [ ] Navigation from project sidebar works correctly
- [ ] Page follows existing design patterns
- [ ] Mobile responsive design

## ðŸš€ Implementation Priority

**Effort Level**: S (Small - single page creation)
**Scope**: FOCUSED (single route fix)
**Priority**: HIGH (blocking functionality)
**AI Credits**: 25 (basic page implementation)
