# Dark Mode Toggle with Inverted Color Scheme

## 📋 Description

Implement a dark mode toggle that provides an inverted color scheme for the entire Maverick platform. This is essential for developer tools as most developers prefer dark themes for reduced eye strain during long coding sessions.

## 🎯 Requirements

### Core Features
- **Toggle Switch**: Accessible dark mode toggle in main navigation
- **Inverted Colors**: Complete color scheme inversion for dark mode
- **Persistence**: User preference saved across sessions
