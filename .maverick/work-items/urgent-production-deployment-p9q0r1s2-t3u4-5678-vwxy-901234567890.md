# URGENT: Deploy Maverick to Production for Demo Links

## 🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**User Need**: "but we need to make sure that deployment is working and we need to get this up there so I can send links"

Need immediate production deployment to flywithmaverick.com so you can share demo links.

## ⚡ FASTEST DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Azure Container Apps (RECOMMENDED - 10 minutes)
```bash
# Install Azure CLI
az login

# Create resource group and container app
az containerapp up \
  --name maverick-prod \
  --resource-group maverick-rg \
  --location eastus \
  --environment maverick-env \
  --source .
```

### Option 2: Azure App Service (15 minutes)
- Perfect for Node.js apps with custom servers
- Integrated with existing Azure email services
- Built-in SSL and custom domain support
- Easy GitHub Actions deployment

### Option 3: Railway (20 minutes)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 4: Render (25 minutes)
1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
2. Configure build/start commands
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Ensure build works: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test production start: `npm run start`
- [ ] Environment variables ready
- [ ] Database accessible

### Railway Deployment (FASTEST)
```bash
# 1. Build the app
npm run build

# 2. Create railway.json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start"
  }
}

# 3. Deploy
railway init maverick-production
railway up
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://flywithmaverick.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🌐 DNS Configuration

### Point Domain to Deployment
1. **Railway**: Get railway app URL, then CNAME
2. **Render**: Get render URL, then CNAME
3. **Custom**: A record to server IP

### DNS Records
```
# For Railway/Render
CNAME: flywithmaverick.com → your-app.railway.app
CNAME: www.flywithmaverick.com → your-app.railway.app

# For custom server
A: flywithmaverick.com → [IP ADDRESS]
```

## 🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS

### Database Setup
- Use Railway PostgreSQL addon
- Or external PostgreSQL (Supabase, Neon)
- Run migrations: `npx prisma db push`

### Quick Production Database
```bash
# Use Railway database
railway add postgresql

# Or external service
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

### SSL Certificate
- Railway/Render handle SSL automatically
- Custom domain needs DNS propagation (24-48 hours)

## ⏰ TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Immediate (30 minutes)
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Get temporary URL working
- [ ] Test core functionality

### Phase 2: Domain Setup (2-24 hours)
- [ ] Configure DNS records
- [ ] Wait for DNS propagation
- [ ] Test flywithmaverick.com
- [ ] SSL certificate active

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (ongoing)
- [ ] Monitor performance
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Configure backups
- [ ] Optimize for scale

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
- [ ] Application deployed and accessible via temporary URL
- [ ] Core features working (project creation, work items)
- [ ] Database connected and functional
- [ ] Authentication working

### Short-term (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] flywithmaverick.com domain pointing to app
- [ ] HTTPS working properly
- [ ] All features tested in production
- [ ] Ready to share demo links

## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Quickstart with Railway
```bash
# 1. Install and login
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login

# 2. Initialize project
railway init

# 3. Add database
