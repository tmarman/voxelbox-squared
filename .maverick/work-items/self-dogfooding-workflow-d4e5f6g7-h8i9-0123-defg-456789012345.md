# Self-Dogfooding Development Workflow

## üìã Vision Statement

Maverick should be used to manage its own development - Claude Code assistant works directly from Maverick work items, documents all implementation progress within those work items, and creates new work items as needed. This creates a self-documenting development process that validates the platform's own capabilities.

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Work from Maverick Work Items
- Claude Code assistant references existing work items in `projects/maverick/work-items/`
- Picks up tasks based on priority and status
- Updates progress directly in the work item files
- Creates new work items when discovering additional requirements

### 2. Document Everything in Work Items
- All implementation decisions documented in work item discussions
- Code changes summarized in work item updates
- Blockers and solutions captured in work item progress
- Cross-references between related work items maintained

### 3. Self-Validating Development
- Use Maverick's own features to manage Maverick development
- Test features by using them for actual development work
- Identify gaps and improvements through real usage
- Continuously improve the platform through dogfooding

## üîÑ Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Work Item Discovery
```typescript
// Process for Claude Code to work from existing work items
1. Scan projects/maverick/work-items/ for PLANNED or IN_PROGRESS status
2. Filter by priority (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
3. Check dependencies and prerequisites
4. Select appropriate work item for current capabilities
5. Update status to IN_PROGRESS with start timestamp
```

### Phase 2: Implementation Documentation
```markdown

- **Blocks**: [Work items waiting for this completion]
- **Related**: [Tangentially related work items]
- **Spawned**: [New work items created during implementation]

## üìã New Work Items Created
- `work-item-uuid-1.md` - [Brief description]
- `work-item-uuid-2.md` - [Brief description]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Work Item Processing System
```typescript
interface WorkItemProcessor {
  // Discovery and selection
  scanAvailableWorkItems(): Promise<WorkItem[]>
  selectNextWorkItem(criteria: SelectionCriteria): Promise<WorkItem>
  checkPrerequisites(workItem: WorkItem): Promise<boolean>
  
  // Progress tracking
  startWorkItem(workItemId: string): Promise<void>
  updateProgress(workItemId: string, update: ProgressUpdate): Promise<void>
  completeWorkItem(workItemId: string, summary: CompletionSummary): Promise<void>
  
  // Cross-references
  linkWorkItems(fromId: string, toId: string, relationship: string): Promise<void>
  createSpawnedWorkItem(parentId: string, description: string): Promise<string>
  updateDependencies(workItemId: string, dependencies: string[]): Promise<void>
}

interface ProgressUpdate {
  timestamp: Date
  message: string
  filesModified?: string[]
  challenges?: string[]
  solutions?: string[]
  nextSteps?: string[]
}
```

### Work Item Status Management
```typescript
enum WorkItemStatus {
  PLANNED = 'PLANNED',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS', 
  IN_REVIEW = 'IN_REVIEW',
  BLOCKED = 'BLOCKED',
  COMPLETED = 'COMPLETED'
}

interface StatusTransition {
  from: WorkItemStatus
  to: WorkItemStatus
  timestamp: Date
  actor: 'claude-code' | 'user' | 'system'
  reason: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

## üìä Benefits of Self-Dogfooding

### For Development Process
- **Real Usage Validation**: Features tested by actual development work
- **Complete Documentation**: Every implementation decision captured
- **Continuous Improvement**: Platform improves through real usage feedback
- **Transparency**: Full development history available to stakeholders

### For Platform Quality
- **Bug Discovery**: Issues found through real usage, not just testing
- **UX Validation**: User experience validated by actual users (developers)
- **Feature Completeness**: Missing features discovered through real needs
- **Performance Testing**: Real workload testing of platform capabilities

### For Team Collaboration
- **Shared Context**: All team members see development progress in real-time
- **Decision History**: Why decisions were made documented in work items
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete implementation history available
- **Async Collaboration**: Progress visible without meetings or status updates

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Implementing Background Processing
```markdown
# Background Feature Analysis with UI Integration

## üí¨ Implementation Progress

### 2025-08-03 07:45:00 - Claude Code Session Started

2. **Select work items based on priority and current capabilities**
3. **Update work item status before starting implementation**
4. **Document all progress within the work item file**
5. **Create new work items for discovered requirements**
6. **Update cross-references and dependencies**
7. **Mark work item as completed with comprehensive summary**

### For Work Item Structure
1. **Keep implementation progress in chronological order**
2. **Include specific file paths and technical details**
3. **Document challenges and solutions for future reference**
