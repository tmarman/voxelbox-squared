Maverick: Product Specification

Overview

Maverick is the AI-native software development platform that generates production-ready applications for businesses. It combines:

AI-Powered Development: Custom applications generated from natural language descriptions

Square Ecosystem Integration: Deep integration with Square's full API suite for payments, inventory, customers

Business Intelligence: AI-powered insights and automated reporting from business data

Professional Development Tools: GitHub integration, version control, and deployment automation

This document outlines the specification for the Maverick platform, focused on making custom software development accessible to business owners without coding experience while maintaining professional-grade quality and Square ecosystem integration.

Visual & Brand Vibe

Aesthetic: Black/white/gray minimalism, similar to Block or OpenAI

Motion: Subtle, fluid transitions; no decoration unless it enhances clarity

Typography: Sans-serif, neutral, unobtrusive â€” content first

Icons: Abstract and line-based; custom for Goose, Formation, etc.

Core Components

1. Maverick Dashboard

Where founders steer their company â€” from formation through growth.

Features:

Formation status (LLC/C-Corp, EIN, state, compliance health)

Linked Square accounts: Banking, POS, Payroll, Online, etc.

Progress tracking (incorporation, app, payments, legal, launch)

AI-assisted guidance ("How do I file a state report?", "Add payroll?")

Human + AI chat channel (Goose)

2. Goose â€” The Embedded AI Assistant

AI-native assistant that helps build, answer, generate, and execute.

Capabilities:

Incorporation Q&A: "LLC vs. C-Corp?" "What docs do I need in California?"

App building: Vibe-coded front/back-end logic from prompts

Compliance generation: Policies, privacy terms, etc.

Modular UX logic: Compose onboarding flows, customer journeys, etc.

Square-native SDK fluency (e.g. payment setup in <5 lines)

3. App Generator (Maverick Studio)

Build real software, not just prototypes â€” and export it.

Outputs:

Full-stack apps (React + Node/Deno or static) with POS / Checkout integration

Offline-first export (ZIP or local project folder)

Editable via Goose, terminal, or visual UI

Option to deploy to Square-managed cloud or BYO host

Supported Frameworks:

Square APIs: Checkout, Catalog, Invoices, Appointments, Loyalty, etc.

GooseKit UI: Pre-styled minimalist components that match Square's design

Auth: OAuth2, biometric fallback, multi-user

4. Formation Layer

Incorporation + compliance + banking as a service

Features:

State-based LLC/C-Corp formation

EIN registration, operating agreement templating

Instant Square Banking + debit card

Registered agent + compliance reminders

Technical Architecture

Frontend: Next.js or React SPA with progressive enhancement

Backend: Edge-ready, Deno or Node (modular functions)

Storage: Local-first builder with encrypted sync option

Goose: RAG-based LLM, model agnostic, API + SDK accessible

MVP Goals

Incorporate + bank account + Square POS setup in <15 minutes

Launch a basic app (e.g. booking site, storefront) in <1 hour

Run entirely offline if needed, with local code export

Launch with 5+ pre-built starter apps (storefront, scheduling, events, etc.)

What Maverick Is (And Isn't)

âœ… A launch platform for ambitious founders and solo entrepreneursâœ… Offline-capable, exportable, local-first business toolingâœ… Tied natively to the Square ecosystem (but not exclusive)ðŸš« Not a no-code toy or landing page generatorðŸš« Not limited to U.S. â€” international-ready formation coming

Next Steps

Finalize GooseKit SDK (components + AI UX)

Secure EIN/state filing APIs + Square Banking hooks

Internal testing with founders using Formation

Design audit to align fully with Block/Goose visual identity

Letâ€™s redefine what it means to start a business â€” fast, local, AI-native, and beautiful.
