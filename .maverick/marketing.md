# Maverick Marketing Strategy & Messaging
*Last Updated: 2025-01-31*

## 📋 Core Value Proposition

**Primary Headline:** "Build Custom Software for Your Business Using AI"
**Tagline:** "AI-Native Software Development Platform"  
**Promise:** "Generate production-ready applications tailored to your business - no coding required, powered by deep Square integration."

## 🎯 Target Audience

### Primary Segments
1. **Square Merchants** - 4M+ existing Square sellers needing custom applications
2. **Small Business Owners** - Need custom software but can't afford $50K+ development costs
3. **Service Business Owners** - Restaurants, retail, salons, fitness, professional services
4. **Entrepreneurs** - Building new businesses that need custom software solutions

### User Journey Stages
1. **Visitor** (not logged in) → Wants to start a business
2. **Prospect** (exploring) → Comparing options, seeing demos
3. **User** (logged in) → Building their business, using tools

## 🚀 Call-to-Action Strategy

### Context-Aware CTAs
**For Visitors (Not Logged In):**
- Primary: "Start Your Business" ✈️
- Secondary: "See Examples" 💼
- Reasoning: Emphasizes the complete business formation process

**For Users (Logged In):**  
- Primary: "Launch App" 🚀
- Secondary: "My Dashboard" 📊
- Reasoning: They already started, now accessing their workspace

**For Demo/Examples:**
- Primary: "Start My Business" 🚀
- Secondary: "Sign In" 
- Reasoning: After seeing value, ready to commit

## 📝 Messaging Framework

### Three Pillars
1. **Business Formation**
   - Headlines: "Legal Formation", "Business Formation" 
   - Description: "LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp—choose the right structure for your business goals"
   - Avoids: Investor-only language, maintains inclusivity

2. **AI Business Partner**
   - Headlines: "AI Mentorship", "AI Business Partner"
   - Description: "Get guidance on product decisions, market strategy, and growth—24/7"
   - Avoids: "Guide every decision" (too controlling)

3. **Custom Software Built**
   - Headlines: "Custom Software", "Built for You"
   - Description: "Production apps, websites, and tools—built to your specs, ready to scale"
   - Avoids: Generic "we build apps" messaging

### Value Proposition Variations
**Primary:** "You bring the vision. We provide the AI mentorship, handle the legal complexity, and build your software. Focus on your customers, not paperwork."

**Short:** "Turn your idea into a complete business—legal formation, custom software, and AI guidance in one platform."

**Benefit-Focused:** "Stop juggling lawyers, developers, and business advisors. Get everything you need to launch in one place."

## 🏗️ Positioning Strategy

### Inspired By Success Models
- **Stripe Atlas:** Makes business formation simple and accessible
- **Lovable/v0.dev:** Empowers users to build without complexity  
- **Our Unique Angle:** Complete business formation + custom software + ongoing AI mentorship

### Competitive Differentiation
1. **vs. Stripe Atlas:** We don't stop at formation—we build your software too
2. **vs. Development Agencies:** We handle the legal foundation first
3. **vs. AI Coding Tools:** We provide complete business strategy, not just code
4. **vs. Business Consultants:** We deliver working software, not just advice

## 🎨 Brand Voice & Tone

### Brand Personality
- **Professional** but approachable
- **Enabling** not overwhelming  
- **Results-focused** not process-obsessed
- **Confident** but not arrogant

### Voice Guidelines
- Use "we" language (partnership approach)
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Keep technical concepts accessible
- Emphasize speed and simplicity

### Avoid
- Aviation/mission control metaphors (except ✈️ emoji sparingly)
- "All-in-one" clichés
- Overly technical jargon
- Controlling language ("we'll manage everything")

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Marketing KPIs

- **Interest:** Demo requests, example page views
