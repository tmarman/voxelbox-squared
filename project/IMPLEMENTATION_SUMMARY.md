- Revenue sharing system

### **GitHub Integration**
- Repository import and transformation
- Automated branch and PR management
- Code generation with project context
- Issue synchronization

## 📊 Technical Decisions & Assumptions

### **Technology Stack Choice: Next.js over .NET/Blazor**

**Rationale:**
- Superior AI ecosystem integration (Claude, OpenAI APIs)
- Better GitHub integration libraries
- Faster MVP development
- Proven by original Maverick team

**Documented Assumptions:**
- WebSocket-based real-time features can be implemented effectively
- Node.js can handle complex business formation workflows
- NextAuth.js provides adequate security for sensitive business data
- Next.js can scale to enterprise-level usage

### **Database Design**
- PostgreSQL chosen for production reliability
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Comprehensive schema covering all Maverick specifications
- Proper foreign key relationships for data integrity

### **Architecture Patterns**
- Next.js App Router for modern routing
- API routes for backend logic
- Component-driven UI development
- Type-safe API contracts with Zod validation
