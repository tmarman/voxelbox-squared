# Technology Stack Decision for Voxelbox

## Evaluation Process

When rebuilding the Maverick platform as Voxelbox, we evaluated two primary technology stacks:

### Option 1: .NET/Blazor
**Advantages:**
- ✅ Enterprise-grade foundation perfect for business formation
- ✅ SignalR for real-time collaboration features
- ✅ Superior authentication with Microsoft Identity
- ✅ Entity Framework Core for complex business logic
- ✅ Better suited for compliance and legal workflows

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Smaller AI/ML ecosystem compared to Node.js
- ❌ Fewer GitHub integration libraries
- ❌ Slower development velocity for MVP
- ❌ Less optimal for template marketplace features

### Option 2: Next.js/TypeScript (Selected)
**Advantages:**
- ✅ **AI-First Ecosystem**: Superior NPM packages for Claude, OpenAI APIs
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Extensive libraries for GitHub API, webhooks
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, TypeScript, easier deployment
- ✅ **Template System**: Better for dynamic content generation
- ✅ **Proven Architecture**: Original Maverick team validated this choice
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Matches original deployment strategy

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ More complex real-time features (requires WebSocket setup)
- ❌ Less enterprise-focused than .NET for business formation

## Final Decision: Next.js/TypeScript

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. **AI-Native Platform**: Voxelbox is fundamentally an AI-powered platform, and the Node.js ecosystem provides superior AI integration capabilities
2. **Template Marketplace**: The core vision includes a dynamic template system that benefits from JavaScript's flexibility
3. **Developer Ecosystem**: GitHub integration and automated development workflows are core features
4. **Rapid Prototyping**: Need to validate the concept quickly with an MVP

## Key Assumptions Made

### 1. **Real-time Features**
- **Assumption**: WebSocket-based real-time collaboration can be implemented effectively in Next.js
- **Mitigation**: Plan to use Socket.io or similar libraries for collaborative document editing

### 2. **Business Formation Workflows**
- **Assumption**: Complex business formation logic can be handled adequately in Node.js
- **Mitigation**: Use TypeScript for type safety, Prisma for data integrity, and external services for legal compliance

### 3. **Enterprise Scalability**
- **Assumption**: Next.js can scale to enterprise-level usage with proper architecture
- **Mitigation**: Design with microservices in mind, use proper database patterns, implement caching strategies

### 4. **Authentication & Security**
- **Assumption**: NextAuth.js provides adequate security for business formation data
- **Mitigation**: Implement additional security measures, audit authentication flows, use encryption for sensitive data

## Technology Stack Summary

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for design system
- Framer Motion for animations

**Backend:**
- Next.js API routes
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Square SDK for payment processing

**AI Integration:**
- Anthropic Claude API (primary)
- OpenAI API (secondary)
- Custom conversation threading system

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel for deployment
- PostgreSQL database (Azure or Supabase)
- GitHub integration for repository management

## Success Metrics

This decision will be validated by:
1. **Development Velocity**: Can we ship an MVP within 4-6 weeks?
2. **AI Integration Quality**: Do AI features work seamlessly?
3. **User Experience**: Is the platform intuitive for non-technical users?
4. **Technical Debt**: Can we maintain and scale the codebase effectively?

## Future Considerations

If Voxelbox grows to enterprise scale, we may consider:
- Hybrid architecture with .NET microservices for complex business logic
- Dedicated real-time services using SignalR or similar
- Enterprise authentication systems integration
- Advanced compliance and audit logging features
